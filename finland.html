                <h1>World Happiness Report 2022</h1><br>
                <p>
                    According to the World Happiness Report, Finland had the highest happiness score in 2022 as Finland scored 78 out of 100. 
                    The country's education system, gender equality, and overall safety contribute to the country's high happiness score. The 
                    Finnish culture of "sisu," which emphasizes resilience, determination, and perseverance, is also thought to contribute to the 
                    country's overall happiness. Furthermore, Finland's emphasis on nature and outdoor activities can be linked to improved mental 
                    health and well-being among its citizens. Because Finnish culture values personal space and privacy, there may be fewer public 
                    displays of generosity. It is worth noting, however, that Finland received a respectable score in the generosity category and 
                    compensated for it with high scores in other categories.

                <h1>Finland: The happiest country in the world</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Finland is considered the happiest country in the world because of its high score in the happiness report. 
                    The country's happiness score has been on the rise in recent years, increasing from a score of 74.5 in 2013 
                    to a score of 78 in 2022. Even the COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly affect the country's happiness, as 
                    it remained a high score during the pandemic. The reasons for Finland's upward trend of happiness could be many. 
                    One key factor is Finland's strong social welfare system, which provides a safety net for citizens in areas such as healthcare, 
                    education, and income security. This system helps to reduce stress and promote a sense of security and stability for individuals and families.
