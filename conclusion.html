                <h1>Comparing the Factors of Happiness Score Among Nordic Countries in 2022</h1><br>
                <p>
                    When it comes to happiness, the Nordic countries seem to have figured it out. The happiness score of Sweden, 
                    Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland for 2022 is strikingly similar. They all have a high GDP per capita, but 
                    Norway takes the lead in this category. Social support is also vital, with Iceland scoring the highest and all 
                    five countries scoring similarly. Healthy life expectancy and freedom to make life choices are also important, as 
                    these countries all have similar scores in these categories. Surprisingly, generosity is not a significant factor in 
                    happiness, with low scores across the cart. Even though Iceland scored the highest, Finland takes the top spot as the world's 
                    happiest country for 2022. Another intriguing category is freedom from corruption, where the scores vary widely among the five countries. 
                    Iceland has the lowest score, despite ranking third in overall happiness.<br><br>
                    To sum it up, all six factors in the Happiness report are essential, but a high GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, 
                    and freedom to make life choices seem to be the most crucial factors in happiness. Generosity and freedom from corruption are also significant 
                    but have less impact on overall happiness scores.

                <h1>A Decade of Nordic Happiness: Insights from the Happiness Report</h1><br>
                <p>
                    The Happiness Report is a fascinating glimpse into the well-being of people around the world. The chart on the right 
                    reveals the happiness scores of five Nordic countries over the past decade. Denmark appears to have been the happiest 
                    country of the five at the beginning of the period, but Norway had a significant jump in score in 2015, while the score 
                    for Iceland was unfortunately missing for 2015. However, from 2016 to 2022, Finland emerged as the clear winner, with a 
                    much higher happiness score than the other countries. Denmark maintained a relatively high happiness score during this period, 
                    while Norway and Sweden lagged slightly behind.<br><br>
                    It is noteworthy that the happiness score for Sweden and Norway decreased somewhat over the last decade, while Iceland's score 
                    slightly increased. However, Denmark's happiness score remained steady, suggesting a consistent level of well-being in the country. 
                    Finally, it is exciting to see Finland's happiness score rise dramatically, making it the happiest country in the world according to the 
                    latest report. This upward trend aligns with the country's emphasis on social welfare and income security, among other factors. Overall, 
                    the Happiness Report and the charts provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to a happy life.
