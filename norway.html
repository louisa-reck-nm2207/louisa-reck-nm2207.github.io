                <h1>World Happiness Report 2022</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Norway is known for its high living standards, beautiful natural landscapes, and progressive social policies. 
                    Norway ranked eighth in the World Happiness Report 2022, with a happiness score of 73.2 out of 100. However, Norway's 
                    score for the generosity factor was relatively low, indicating that citizens' willingness to contribute to charitable causes 
                    and help those in need could be improved. This finding may be related to Norway's high GDP per capita, which may make people 
                    feel financially secure and less inclined to donate to charity. It's also worth noting that Norway has a relatively small population 
                    of around 5.4 million people, which means that its wealth is distributed among fewer people. This may explain why its generosity factor 
                    score was relatively low, as people may feel less obligated to contribute to charitable causes when they believe they are financially secure.

                <h1>Norway: More then just a high GDP per capita</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Over the last decade, Norway has consistently ranked among the top countries in the World Happiness Report, 
                    with a happiness score ranging from 72.9 in 2020 to 76 in 2015 and 2016*. However, its score has recently 
                    decreased slightly. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted many factors that contribute to overall happiness, 
                    such as social connections, economic stability, and mental and physical health, is likely one of the causes of this decline. 
                    Additionally, the pandemic has disrupted daily life and caused stress and uncertainty for many people, which may have had a negative 
                    impact on their well-being. Despite this decline, Norway remains one of the happiest countries in the world.<br><br>
