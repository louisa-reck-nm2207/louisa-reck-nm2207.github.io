                <h1>World Happiness Report 2022</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Sweden ranked sixth in the World Happiness Report 2022, with a happiness score of 74 out of 100. However,
                    when we look at the factors contributing to this value, we see that the country received a relatively low
                    score for the generosity factor. Sweden has a well-developed welfare state and a high taxation level, implying
                    that the government has already met many social needs. As a result, there may be less of a cultural tradition
                    of private charitable donations compared to other countries with weaker social safety nets. Furthermore, 
                    the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced Sweden's generosity score. People may have found it more challenging to 
                    donate money because of the pandemic's effects on the economy. Despite receiving a lower score for generosity, Sweden 
                    received high scores in other factors contributing to overall happiness.

                <p>
                    Sweden's World Happiness Scores between 2013 and 2022 show that the country's happiness level has remained consistently
                    high, with a range of only 72.4 to 74.4 during this period. Sweden's happiness index reached its highest point in the previous
                    ten years in 2021, scoring 74.4. This indicates that, despite the challenges posed by events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                    Sweden has successfully maintained a high level of happiness and well-being among its citizens. <br><br>
                    Several factors have contributed to Sweden's high ranking over the years. The country provides excellent healthcare, education,
                    and other public services. Sweden values work-life balance as well, emphasizing shorter work weeks, parental leave, and flexible
                    work arrangements. Furthermore, Sweden has a low level of corruption. The country is also known for emphasizing sustainability, 
                    innovation, and design, which may contribute to its citizens' sense of well-being.
